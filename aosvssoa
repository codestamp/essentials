Selecting AoS or SoA depends on the memory access pattern.


****************************
struct {
	uint8_t r,g,b;
} AoS[N];


struct {
	uint8_t r[N];
	uint8_t g[N];
	uint8_t b[N];
} SoA;
***************************

If R/G/B components of a pixel need to be concurrently accessed we 
go for AoS.

If a single channel R/G/B of all pixels need to be modified/ processed together
then we opt for SoA.

The selection plays a major role in memeory coalescing.
